# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Nexa Agentic Engineering Marketplace is a collection of plugins for Claude Code that implement the Nexa Agentic Engineering methodology.
The repository is structured as a marketplace with a two-layer architecture: a stack-agnostic core and
technology-specific plugins.

## Plugin Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

- **nexa-claude-core** — Stack-agnostic methodology: from vision to use case specification. Works with any tech stack.
- **nexa-claude-nextjs** — Stack-specific: implementation, testing, and delivery for the Next.js stack. Requires nexa-claude-core.

### Marketplace Configuration

- `marketplace.json` defines the marketplace with owner info and an array of plugins
- Each plugin entry has `name`, `source` (path), and `description`

### Plugin Structure

Each plugin contains:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin metadata (name, version, author)
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server configurations for external tools
- `skills/` - Skills with SKILL.md definitions; each skill is also a slash command

## Skill Naming Conventions

- **`setup-` prefix** — Skills that establish **foundational infrastructure, configuration, or tooling** for the repository must be prefixed with `setup-` (e.g., `setup-env-profiles`, `setup-i18n`, `setup-web-middleware`, `setup-playwright-ci`). These are typically run once but may be re-run when requirements change (new roles, new locales, new environments). When creating a new skill, check whether it sets up cross-cutting or foundational concerns; if so, name it `setup-<name>` and place it under the Setup phase accordingly.
- All other skills (run repeatedly during development) use plain names without a prefix.

## Nexa Agentic Engineering Workflow

Skills follow the Nexa Agentic Engineering phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Infrastructure.

### Core (stack-agnostic)

| Phase        | Skill (slash command) | Description                            |

| Setup        | `/setup-project-rules`| Write Nexa workflow enforcement rules into the project's CLAUDE.md |
| Inception    | `/requirements`       | Generate requirements from vision      |
| Elaboration  | `/entity-model`       | Create entity model with Mermaid ER    |
| Elaboration  | `/use-case-diagram`   | Generate PlantUML use case diagrams    |
| Elaboration  | `/generate-wireframe` | Generate low-fidelity wireframe from use cases |
| Elaboration  | `/engineer-requirements` | Clustered elaboration of all use cases with interactive refinement |

## Git

- Do NOT bump the `version` field in `**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` files. Always keep the version at `1.0.0` because the path is referenced in the instructions, in the skills.
